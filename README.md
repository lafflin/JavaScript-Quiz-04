## My process

1. The first thing I did was go through the README and write out psuedocode to get an idea of how to the project was going to work. I then went to class, got some questions I had after making the psuedocode answered during office hours, and started the next day.
2. I did a bit of work on it the following day, leading into a tutoring session in which my tutor was hugely helpful, as my tutor assisted me in creating a skeleton for how my JavaScript would work.
